## 原则课0.0

Trust in Truth   

>* While the truth itself may be scary,  
knowing the truth will allow you to deal with your situation better.  

>* Being truthful, and letting others be truthful with you, allows you to explore your own thoughts and exposes you to the feedback that is essential for your learning.  

>* **PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE WAY ON THE INSIDE AND ANOTHER ON THE OUTSIDE** become conflicted and often lose touch with their own values.  
**表里不一的人**往往会自相矛盾，也容易丢失自己的价值观。

Be extremely open(open,开放/坦诚)  

>* The main reason Bridgewater performs well is that **ALL PEOPLE HERE HAVE THE POWER TO SPEAK OPENLY AND EQUALLY AND BECAUSE THEIR VIEWS ARE JUDGED ON THE MERITS OF WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.**  
桥水联合基金的成功经验之一就是**公司所有人都能够以开放的、平等的方式进行沟通，他们的观点会得到客观公正的对待。**  

>*  It is**A SELF-REINFORCING, VIRTUOUS CYCLE.**  
这是**一个自我增强的过程，一个良性循环。**

Have integrity and demand it from others.  
为人正直，要求别人也保持正直。

>* Integrity comes from the Latin word integer,meaning “one.” **PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE WAY ON THE INSIDE AND ANOTHER WAY OUTSIDE LACK INTEGRITY; THEY HAVE DUALITY.**   
英文中的正直（integrity）一词来源于拉丁语的整体（integer）一词，含有唯一性。**表里不一的人缺少唯一性，他们具有两面性。**

>* Thinking SOLELY about what’s accurate instead of how it is PERCEIVED helps you to be more focused on important things. 

>* HAVING NOTHING TO HIDE RELIEVES STRESS. IT ALSO BUILDS TRUST.
  * Never say anything about a person you wouldn’t say to them directly, and don’t try people without accusing them to their face  
   若当面不对别人进行评论，背地里也不要说。若未曾当面控诉过别人，也不要背地里试探。  
  * Don’t let “loyalty” stand in the way of truth and openness.  
    unhealthy loyalty stands in the way of improvement 不健康的忠诚就是阻碍进步的拦路虎。 
    Healthy loyalty fosters improvement through openly addressing mistakes and weaknesses. 健康的忠诚通过坦诚应对错误和弱点实现进步  
    The more people are open about their challenges, the more helpful others can be.  人们越是对自己的问题开诚布公，越是能够获得他人的帮助。

Be radically transparent.  
要极为透明  

>* Provide people with as much exposure as possible to what’s going on around them.   
   尽可能多的为人们提供对周围事物的知情权。  

>* The candid question-and-answer process allows people to probe your thinking. You can then modify your thinking to get at the best possible answer, reinforcing your confidence that you’re on the best possible path.   
   坦诚的问答模式让人们挑战你的想法，从而促使你不断修改，直到获得最佳方案。这一过程会增强你的信心，保证自己是在最正确的方向上前行。

>* Record almost all meetings and share them with all relevant people.  
   记录每一次会议，并分享给所有相关人士。
   * If someone gives you confidential information, keep it confidential until you have permission to disclose it. 当别人给了你保密信息，在获得披露许可之前，你都必须严守秘密。

Don’t tolerate dishonesty.  
对不诚实零容忍。  

>* People typically aren’t totally honest, which stands in the way of progress, so don’t tolerate this.  
   无法做到完全诚实是人之本性，但这却阻碍了人取得进步，因此，不该容忍不诚实的现象。

>* Don’t believe it when someone caught being dishonest says they have seen the light and will never do that sort of thing again.  
   不要相信不诚实之人说他已痛改前非，绝不再犯。他们很可能重蹈覆辙。
