## POOR Charlie's Almanack·Notes 0


# Charlie counts preparation, patience,discipline, and objectivity among his most fundamental guiding principles.

* preparation: **arrangements for sth that is going to happen.**
* patience: **the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious.**
* discipline: **the ability to control your own behaviour, so that you do what you are expected to do.**
* objectivity: **not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts.**

***

# All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.


***

# What I'm against is being very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that your particular action will do more good than harm. You' re dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is interacting with everything else.

* where: **in which place or part.**
* interact: **if one thing interacts with another, or if they interact, they affect each other.**

# "Personally, I've gotten so that I use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various ways——which, by and large, are useful——but which often malfunction? One approach is rationality—— the way you'd work out a bridge problem, by evaluating the real interest, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions——many of which are wrong."


* subconscious: **subconscious feelings, desires etc are hidden in your mind and affect your behaviour, but you do not know that you have them.**  
* automatically: **as a result of a situation or action, and without you having to do anything more.** 
* by and large: **in generally**
* malfuction: **(of a piece of equipment or machinery) fail to function normally**



***

# Quickly Eliminate the Big Universe of What Not to Do, Follow Up with a Fluent, Multidisciplinary Attack on What Remains, Then Act Decisively When, and Only When, the Right Circumstances Appear.

* eliminate: **to completely get rid of sth that is unnecessary or unwanted**
* fluent: **done in a smooth and easy way**
* multidisciplinary: **combining or involving several academic disciplines or professional specializations in an approach to a topic or problem**
* decisive: **having or showing the ability to make decisions quickly and effectively**(decisively)
* circumstance: **(usu. circumstances) a fact or condition connencted with or relevant to an event or action**

# Apply logic to help avoid fooling yourself. Charlie will not accept anything I say just because I say it, although most of the world will.——Warren Buffett


***


# Never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool.——Richard P.Feynman


***

# "Hard work is an essential element in tracking down and perfecting a strategy or in executing it." 



* perfect(v.): **to make sth as good as you are able to**
* execute: **to do sth that has been carefully planned**



For Charlie and Warren, the hard work is continuous, whether it results in current investing activity or not——and usually it does not.

# This habit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is no accident. It is the blend of discipline and patience exhibited by true masters of a craft: an uncompromising commitment to "properly playing the hand."


* commit: **to decide to use money, time people etc for a particular purpose**(commit sth to sth)
* blend: **a mixture of different things that combine together well**
* exhibit: **to clear show a particular quality, emotion, or ability**
* craft: ** the skills needed for a particular profession**
* uncompromising: **unnwilling to change your opinions or intentions**



***




# Again, we see the important role played by the right kinds of temperamental qualities: self-discipline, patience, calm, independence. Charlie's level of investment performance is arguably impossible without them.

* arguably: **used when giving your opinion to say that there are good reasons why sth might be true**
